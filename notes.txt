Spring Initializer
-Spring Web
-Lombok
-Spring Security
-Spring Data JPA
-MySQL Driver
-Java Mail Sender


Git:
git init
git add .
git commit m "Message"
git remote add origin url.git
git push origin master

Lombok generates boilerplate code at compile time

@Data - generates getter and setters
@Entity
@Builder - generates builder methods for the class : Builder design pattern


@NotBlank needs this after Spring 2.3.0
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
</dependency>

@ManyToOne?? 
@JoinColumn??
?GenertationType

LAZY = fetch when needed
EAGER = fetch immediately


sprint.datasource.initialize=true runs when there is a schema.sql in src/main/resources

@ManyToOne(fetch=FetchType.LAZY) is needed or else might get error while creating tables

MySQL -> Show Engines;
InnoDB : Default, Transaction support, row-level locking, foreign key
SQL engine is defined as software that recognizes and interprets SQL commands to access a relational database and interrogate data.


Extend WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter and override its configure(http) method
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces authenticated users to submit a request to a Web application against which they are currently authenticated. CSRF attacks exploit the trust a Web application has in an authenticated user.
So we disable it. 

Instant : Date/Time purpose

RegisterRequest -> Data Transfer Objects (DTO)

Spring recommends constructor injector rather than field injection. So we would avoid @Autowiring

@Transactional : because we are using SQL Database Transaction

Thymeleaf: HTML Template Creation for Emails 
<span th:text="${message}"></span> : For thymeleaf message injection

Slf4j : Logger object

SpringRedditException custom exception to give general message to user in case of exception rather than giving technical details

MailTrap : Email Testing app

@Lob: LargeObject

??Email validation is failing

auth/{token} -> @PathVariable String token


User registration takes time- 10-11 sec, because we are sending mail to external server
Can run mail sending functionality Asynchronously in a different thread
@EnableAsync in main method
@Async on top of method

Alternate: MessageQueues like RabbitMQ or ActiveMQ : They provide reliability.
But too heavyweight for our usecase

@NotBlank -> should not be null or empty, atleast one non-whitespace character
@NotEmpty -> should not be null or empty


Auth Flow
1. Login req (client->server)
2. Server creates JWT
3. Server sends JWT to client
4.Client uses JWT to authenticate itself
5.Server Validates JWT
6. Server Responds to client


Sometimes org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User is used

???Authentication Steps

AuthenticationManager
For an interface we we do not specify which bean to create, then spring throws an exception since there are multiple implementations


JWT Dependencies: jjwt-api, jjwt-impl, jjwt-jackson

The JWT token is mainly composed of header, payload, signature.

??KeyStore Steps

To know if the user is logged in or not we can look into SecurityContextHolder object

A circular dependency between bean A and bean B will force one of the beans to be injected into the other prior to being fully initialized itself (a classic chicken/egg scenario).
spring.main.allow-circular-references=true

Now Validate JSON Web Token
Client -> JWT Filter -> Controller
If token is valid, spring will find it inside Security COntext, else throw exception
Avoid writing business logic in controllers, delegate the request to service layer


??@Transactional(readOnly = true)
Spring security should know about our jwtauthenticationfilter class
Spring tries this filter before trying username password authentication scheme

MappingStruct : Mapping code to map two objects in java by just using annotations.
Cumbersome to map pojo classes with large number of fields. Makes that tasks easy

Add lombok depency in annotationProcessorPaths of mapstruct
@InheritInverseConfiguration opposite mapping to the mapping

see the class CommentMapperImpl inside the target/generated-sources/annotations/com/example/../mapper path
m2e-apt install from marketplace
mvn clean install

Marketplace connection issue:
The solution is:

Go to-Window->Preferences->General->Network Connections

Choose "Active Provider" To "Direct"

then click "apply" and then "ok".

It will Start Opening.

Add Post Controller/Service/Mapper and associated exceptions
Post will be created only when subreddit exists. Or else will give internal server error
